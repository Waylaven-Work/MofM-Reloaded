# MofM-Reloaded
Project in GMS-2

Coded by Trevor Bartlett using initial resorces from http://www.heartbeast.co/courses

This is a side project to gain more insight into the gamemaking process. The goal of this project is to make a 2-D RPG
in Game Maker Studio 2, with no help other than online tutorials.
