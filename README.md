# MofM-Reloaded
Project in GMS-2

Coded by Trevor Bartlett using initial resorces from http://www.heartbeast.co/courses

This is a side project to gain more insight into the gamemaking process. The goal of this project is to make a 2-D RPG
in Game Maker Studio 2, with no help other than online tutorials.

This is a continuation of the project I started earlier last semester, but this version is a cleaner rewrite that is meant to
be neat enough to feel confortable submitting alongside resumes and such. The previous repository was filled with nonsense
and generally not friendly commit messages. Also the account had random snippits of school work and general clutter.
As such, this version should be much more readable.

If for some reason you wanted to see the previous repo if not just to laugh at the contents, it can be found at https://github.com/Waylaven
